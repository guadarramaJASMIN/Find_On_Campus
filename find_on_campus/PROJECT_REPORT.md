## Project Summary
Find On Campus is a mobile application designed to help students and faculty easily report and search for lost or found items on campus. The app aims to simplify the lost and found process by creating a centralized digital platform where users can:

- Report items they've lost on campus
- Report items they've found on campus
- Search for lost or found items with filters
- Get notified of potential matches
- Track the status of their reports
- Contact item owners or finders
- Earn reward points for helping return items

The application is built using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility (Android, iOS, and web) and Firebase as the backend for authentication, database, storage, and notifications.

## Design Changes Since Proposal
While maintaining our core vision, we've made the following refinements to the project since our proposal:

1. **Enhanced Matching System**: Implemented an automatic matching algorithm that suggests potential matches between lost and found items based on category, date, and location.

2. **Reward Points System**: Added gamification through a reward points system to encourage user engagement. Users earn points for reporting found items and when items they found are claimed.

3. **Status Tracking**: Added more detailed status tracking for items (Pending, Resolved, Claimed) to better manage the lifecycle of lost/found items.

4. **UI/UX Improvements**: Refined the user interface with a more intuitive navigation system and color-coding (red for lost items, green for found items) for better visual distinction.
